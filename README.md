### What I learned

I was very simple, I made it for mobile screen first. Keeping eye on details it was very easy

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.container {
  background-color: var(--white);
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1.15rem;
  margin-top: 4rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  border-radius: 1.5rem;
}
```
